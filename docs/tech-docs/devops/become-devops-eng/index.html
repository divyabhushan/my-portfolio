TCP/IP (Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), SSL, SSH (Secure Shell), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name Server).</p><p>Configuration management tools like Ansible and Jenkins can be used to configure and orchestrate network devices.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="35-what-is-and-how-to-set-up"></a>3.5 What is and how to set-up<a class="hash-link" href="#35-what-is-and-how-to-set-up" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As a DevOps methodology we often describe CI/CD pipeline, let us understand what is it?</p><p><em>Continuous Integration</em>(CI) is a development practice wherein ­­developers regularly merge or integrate their code changes into a commonly shared repos­itory very frequently.</p><p>If I speak from a VCS (preferably Git’s) point of view -<br>
Every minor code change done on various branches (from different contributors) is pushed and integrated with the main release branch several times a day, rather than waiting for the complete feature to be developed.</p><p>Every code check-in is then verified by an automated build and automated test cases. This approach helps to detect and fix the bugs early, resolve the conflicts that may arise, improve software quality, reduce the validation and feedback loop time; hence increasing the overall product quality and speedy product releases.</p><p><em>Continuous Delivery(CD)</em> is a software practice where every code check-in is automatically built, tested and ready for a release(delivery) to production. Every code check-in should be release/deployment ready.</p><p>CD phase delivers the code to a production-like-environment such as dev, uat, preprod, etc and runs automated tests.</p><p>On successful implementation of continuous delivery in the prod-like environment, the code is ready to be deployed to the main production server.</p><p>It is best to learn the DevOps lifecycle of continuous development, continuous build, continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment and continuous monitoring throughout the complete product lifecycle.</p><p>Based on the DevOps process setup use the right tools to facilitate the CI/CD pipeline.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="36-learn-infrastructure-as-code"></a>3.6 Learn Infrastructure as code<a class="hash-link" href="#36-learn-infrastructure-as-code" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Infrastructure as code (IaC) is to define(or declare) and manage the infrastructure resources programmatically by writing code as configuration files instead of managing each resource individually.</p><p>These infrastructure resources(hardware and software) may be set up on a physical server, a Virtual machine or cloud.</p><p>An IaC defines the desired state of the machine and generates the same environment every time it is compiled.</p><p>What does IaC do?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Automation:</strong> Spinning up or scaling down many resources becomes easier, as just a configuration file needs to be compiled and run.
